# Open 2 Internet
This is a binary rust package, that allows you to redirect and automatically open ports to your "LAN shared" Minecraft single player world.

It features
- Custom Lease time
- Custom external port
- List of running Minecraft LAN worlds
- GUI frontend

TODO:
- Get more info from Minecraft server (version, world name,...)


# Build it yourself
Clone it
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mglolenstine/open2internet
```
Build it
```
$ cargo build --release
```
you should have your executable located in the `target/release/open2internet`

or run it directly
```
$ cargo run
```

or you could just skip all of that and just type
```
$ cargo install https://github.com/mglolenstine/open2internet
```
